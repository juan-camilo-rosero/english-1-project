    content: `The video "culture shock" talks about the stages that some people often feel during the of adapting to a new cultural environment. First, it describes the "honeymoon," which is the moment when the person feels that everything is beautiful. This process usually takes two months, but the times depend on every person. The second stage is the frustration, and during this period, people realize that it’s not as perfect as they thought. They start to have difficulty with local norms and get frustrated. After this stage, which usually lasts four months, it’s the "adjustment". When people start getting familiar with the customs and traditions in the culture and start feeling like home., there is the adaptation. It could take close to one year to get to this point, according to research done in the 1950s. An example of this culture shock is the Paris Syndrome. Here, tourists usually get disappointed and frustrated when they go to this city because they realize that Paris is not as perfect as they thought. They can feel anxious or even have hallucinations. Another example is the reverse culture shock. When people return home, they can experience the four stages.\n As I mentioned before, this process is inherent to every person, and the times are not always the same. For example, when toddlers are forced to move to a new school, they can skip the honeymoon stage and jump right into the frustration if they are alone. For that reason, some schools encourage parents to be with their children during the moment. Another example of the personal culture shock process are persons that don’t advance to the adjustment stage and get stuck for life in the frustration.\n To conclude, culture shock is a process that people usually feel when they have to adapt to a new culture, and even when there are four usual stages, each individual experiences it uniquely.`,

    title: "Derry Girls is overvalued",

    content: `Derry Girls takes place in an Irish city called Londonderry during a period of widespread violence. The plot is simple: Erin Quinn, a teenager, tries to get through her first day of school with her friends and an English boy, who happens to be the only male student there. Although Erin tries her best to avoid trouble, the day descends into chaos, and she and her group of friends are accused of murdering one of the teachers.\n
    
    It may sound very cartoonish, but that’s the purpose of the show: shedding light on the reality of violence from the perspective not of soldiers, but of ordinary people living their "normal" daily lives and normalizing the war around them. There are many incredible movies with a similar premise, such as Jojo Rabbit and Life is Beautiful. However, there is a significant difference. Unlike Derry Girls, these films take themselves seriously and aim to move the audience rather than simply entertain them.\n
    
    I love the idea of portraying the daily lives of a group of girls in a war-torn society, but the combination of exaggerated acting, poor production quality, and a dull script makes Derry Girls an overrated series. In the end, it’s just a great idea with poor execution.`,

    title: "OpenAI Lore",
    type: "text",
    content: `The history of OpenAI reminds us of the beginnings of Silicon Valley. Huge empires are born out of betrayals, fights, and, above all, the minds of geniuses like Demis Hassabis, Ilya Sutskever, Jen-Hsun Huang, and Dario Amodei.\n

    Some of the companies leading the current AI boom include Google’s Gemini, Amazon’s Anthropic, China’s DeepSeek, Nvidia, and Apple. However, the current leader is OpenAI, the startup backed by Microsoft behind models like DALL-E and ChatGPT. What few people know is that OpenAI was born during a fight at a birthday party (specifically, one between two of the world’s biggest billionaires).\n

    To start this story, we must go back to 2015. Google was the leader in AI development. Their team included Geoffrey Hinton, Demis Hassabis, Ilya Sutskever (who would later become the brain behind OpenAI), and Jeff Dean, divided into two teams: Google Brain, which would publish two years later “Attention is All You Need” (the paper that changed the whole industry) and DeepMind, which was about to make history with its AlphaGo model.\n

    DeepMind was acquired in 2014 for $500 million, with investors like Peter Thiel, Jaan Tallinn, Elon Musk, and Larry Page (Google’s co-founder). The last two were besties. To give you an idea, Elon used to sleep at Larry’s house after fights with his wife.\n

    For Elon’s birthday, his wife decided to throw a party at a remote location with over 50 close friends, including obviously the Google’s founder. One night, when they were in a campfire, they began debating the future of humanity. Larry believed that humans would eventually combine with computers, while Elon argued that if that happened, humanity would be destroyed. The conversation escalated, with Larry calling Elon a “speciesist,” accusing him of siding with humans. Elon took this personally, (lit they never spoke again after that)\n

    Over time, Elon became increasingly concerned that Google, with Larry Page, were a threat to humanity. His fear grew in October when DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated the world champion in Go, introducing new strategies. Motivated by this, Elon decided to create OpenAI with Sam Altman (daddy, if I say what I want with him, I'll be kicked out of the course.), a 30-year-old who, despite his age, was president of Y Combinator, the most prestigious accelerator of Silicon Valley, responsible for companies like AirBnB, Dropbox, Reddit, Twitch, Stripe and Rappi.\n

    Since 2022, with the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI has rapidly scaled up, but it hasn't been a staaaaable company that you say “woh, the most stable company”. There have been multiple attempts to fire Sam Altman, and each time, Sam has strengthened his position, even firing those who opposed him. These tensions led to the creation of companies like Anthropic’s Claude, XAI, SSI, and others, while key team members such as Elon, Ilya, Dario Amodei, and, more recently, Mira Murati, have left.. Recently, DeepSeek launched as a new competitor that could challenge all the other AI companies, so there will be a lot of AI lore :D
