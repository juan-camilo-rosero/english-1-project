    content: `Derry Girls takes place in an Irish city called Londonderry during a period of widespread violence. The plot is simple: Erin Quinn, a teenager, tries to get through her first day of school with her friends and an English boy, who happens to be the only male student there. Although Erin tries her best to avoid trouble, the day descends into chaos, and she and her group of friends are accused of murdering one of the teachers.

    It may sound very cartoonish, but that’s the purpose of the show: shedding light on the reality of violence from the perspective not of soldiers, but of ordinary people living their "normal" daily lives and normalizing the war around them. There are many incredible movies with a similar premise, such as Jojo Rabbit and Life is Beautiful. However, there is a significant difference. Unlike Derry Girls, these films take themselves seriously and aim to move the audience rather than simply entertain them.

    I love the idea of portraying the daily lives of a group of girls in a war-torn society, but the combination of exaggerated acting, poor production quality, and a dull script makes Derry Girls an overrated series. In the end, it’s just a great idea with poor execution.`,
