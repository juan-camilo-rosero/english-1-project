    content: `The video "culture shock" talks about the stages that some people often feel during the of adapting to a new cultural environment. First, it describes the "honeymoon," which is the moment when the person feels that everything is beautiful. This process usually takes two months, but the times depend on every person. The second stage is the frustration, and during this period, people realize that it’s not as perfect as they thought. They start to have difficulty with local norms and get frustrated. After this stage, which usually lasts four months, it’s the "adjustment". When people start getting familiar with the customs and traditions in the culture and start feeling like home., there is the adaptation. It could take close to one year to get to this point, according to research done in the 1950s. An example of this culture shock is the Paris Syndrome. Here, tourists usually get disappointed and frustrated when they go to this city because they realize that Paris is not as perfect as they thought. They can feel anxious or even have hallucinations. Another example is the reverse culture shock. When people return home, they can experience the four stages.\n As I mentioned before, this process is inherent to every person, and the times are not always the same. For example, when toddlers are forced to move to a new school, they can skip the honeymoon stage and jump right into the frustration if they are alone. For that reason, some schools encourage parents to be with their children during the moment. Another example of the personal culture shock process are persons that don’t advance to the adjustment stage and get stuck for life in the frustration.\n To conclude, culture shock is a process that people usually feel when they have to adapt to a new culture, and even when there are four usual stages, each individual experiences it uniquely.`,

    title: "Derry Girls is overvalued",

    content: `Derry Girls takes place in an Irish city called Londonderry during a period of widespread violence. The plot is simple: Erin Quinn, a teenager, tries to get through her first day of school with her friends and an English boy, who happens to be the only male student there. Although Erin tries her best to avoid trouble, the day descends into chaos, and she and her group of friends are accused of murdering one of the teachers.\n
    
    It may sound very cartoonish, but that’s the purpose of the show: shedding light on the reality of violence from the perspective not of soldiers, but of ordinary people living their "normal" daily lives and normalizing the war around them. There are many incredible movies with a similar premise, such as Jojo Rabbit and Life is Beautiful. However, there is a significant difference. Unlike Derry Girls, these films take themselves seriously and aim to move the audience rather than simply entertain them.\n
    
    I love the idea of portraying the daily lives of a group of girls in a war-torn society, but the combination of exaggerated acting, poor production quality, and a dull script makes Derry Girls an overrated series. In the end, it’s just a great idea with poor execution.`,

    title: "OpenAI Lore",
    type: "text",
    content: `The history of OpenAI reminds us of the beginnings of Silicon Valley. Huge empires are born out of betrayals, fights, and, above all, the minds of geniuses like Demis Hassabis, Ilya Sutskever, Jen-Hsun Huang, and Dario Amodei.\n

    Some of the companies leading the current AI boom include Google’s Gemini, Amazon’s Anthropic, China’s DeepSeek, Nvidia, and Apple. However, the current leader is OpenAI, the startup backed by Microsoft behind models like DALL-E and ChatGPT. What few people know is that OpenAI was born during a fight at a birthday party (specifically, one between two of the world’s biggest billionaires).\n

    To start this story, we must go back to 2015. Google was the leader in AI development. Their team included Geoffrey Hinton, Demis Hassabis, Ilya Sutskever (who would later become the brain behind OpenAI), and Jeff Dean, divided into two teams: Google Brain, which would publish two years later “Attention is All You Need” (the paper that changed the whole industry) and DeepMind, which was about to make history with its AlphaGo model.\n

    DeepMind was acquired in 2014 for $500 million, with investors like Peter Thiel, Jaan Tallinn, Elon Musk, and Larry Page (Google’s co-founder). The last two were besties. To give you an idea, Elon used to sleep at Larry’s house after fights with his wife.\n

    For Elon’s birthday, his wife decided to throw a party at a remote location with over 50 close friends, including obviously the Google’s founder. One night, when they were in a campfire, they began debating the future of humanity. Larry believed that humans would eventually combine with computers, while Elon argued that if that happened, humanity would be destroyed. The conversation escalated, with Larry calling Elon a “speciesist,” accusing him of siding with humans. Elon took this personally, (lit they never spoke again after that)\n

    Over time, Elon became increasingly concerned that Google, with Larry Page, were a threat to humanity. His fear grew in October when DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated the world champion in Go, introducing new strategies. Motivated by this, Elon decided to create OpenAI with Sam Altman (daddy, if I say what I want with him, I'll be kicked out of the course.), a 30-year-old who, despite his age, was president of Y Combinator, the most prestigious accelerator of Silicon Valley, responsible for companies like AirBnB, Dropbox, Reddit, Twitch, Stripe and Rappi.\n

    Since 2022, with the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI has rapidly scaled up, but it hasn't been a staaaaable company that you say “woh, the most stable company”. There have been multiple attempts to fire Sam Altman, and each time, Sam has strengthened his position, even firing those who opposed him. These tensions led to the creation of companies like Anthropic’s Claude, XAI, SSI, and others, while key team members such as Elon, Ilya, Dario Amodei, and, more recently, Mira Murati, have left.. Recently, DeepSeek launched as a new competitor that could challenge all the other AI companies, so there will be a lot of AI lore :D

    type: "audio",
    content: `Hello to all our listeners. My name is Juliana, today on the show we'll be interviewing José, a film and television student who will share his insights on this wonderful art.
    First question:
    
    1. How did your interest in film begin, and what motivated you to study this career?

    Personally, I'm more drawn to personal stories in cinema, not those that try to represent reality but rather create their own. I enjoy everyday themes taken to the extraordinary.

    2. If you could change something about the current film industry, what would it be?

    Speaking of that , I think there should be a change in the representation of conflict without resorting to poverty porn as a narrative device. Although I feel this change is already happening, and some authors have made efforts to tell stories closer to their social contexts.

    3. What's your opinion on sequels, remakes, and adaptations? Do you think original cinema is in danger?

    I think this question is more aimed at major production companies that can produce films in that manner and have the means to do so. I don't think there's such a thing as completely original cinema, but I do believe there can be very obvious rehashing of ideas generated by public demand. The consuming public is who depends on and demands what type of movies they want to see.

    yes, I agree 4. How do you think film can influence society? Do you believe it can change the way people think or act?

    I feel that cinema presents ideas to people, but ultimately, it's up to them to decide the impact on their lives. Often, people extrapolate personal issues into movies and lose sight of the fact that they're just films with their own diegetic worlds. This creates problems of misrepresentation of course or discord between ideologies.

    The last question is 3. Is there a film that you consider changed your perspective on cinema or life in general?

    There are several films that have changed my perspective on what I want to achieve as a filmmaker. However, I'm personally very influenced by the cinema of German director Wim Wenders. His seemingly simple stories are loaded with strong emotions and recognizable characters that the viewer can sense have a story before and after the film's duration.

    okey, Thank you for your time José

    Thank you Juliana.

    title: "Debate on Education",
    type: "video",
    content: `**Moderator's Introduction**
    Moderator:
    **Good morning and welcome to today's debate. We will analyze the appointment of José Ismael
    Peña Reyes as rector of the National University of Colombia in 2024, a process that has sparked
    various reactions, particularly among students. Our panelists are all students from the university,
    who will share their perspectives on this issue. They are:
    1. Michael Villalba, a Law student.
    2. Juan Camilo, a Political Science student.
    3. Juliana Pinilla, a Sociology student.
    Each will present their viewpoint on the appointment process and how it affects the student
    community and university autonomy.**

    **First Round: Initial Arguments**
    Michael Villalba:
    **The appointment of José Ismael Peña Reyes as rector was a process that, although it followed
    regulatory guidelines, left many doubts about the actual participation of students. From my
    perspective, it is essential that we, as students, have a more active voice in these decisions, since
    we are a vital part of the university community and the ones who experience the consequences of
    these appointments on a daily basis.**

    Juan Camilo:
    **I agree with Michael that student participation was limited. However, I believe the issue goes
    deeper. The appointment of Peña Reyes reflects a disconnect between the authorities and the real
    needs of students. Many of us supported Leopoldo Múnera because he represented a more
    inclusive and democratic vision for the university. His exclusion from the process generated
    frustration and distrust.**

    **Second Round: Interaction and Debate Among Panelists**
    Moderator:
    **Thank you for your contributions. Now, let’s open the discussion. How do you think student
    participation could be improved in future rector appointment processes?**

    Michael Villalba:
    **I believe it is necessary to establish clearer and more formal mechanisms for student
    participation. For example, we could have student representatives with voice and vote on the
    University Superior Council. Additionally, broad and binding consultations should be conducted to
    gather the opinions of the student community before making such important decisions.**

    Juan Camilo:
    **I agree with Michael, but I also think we need to go further. The university should implement
    periodic student assemblies where relevant topics, such as the appointment of the rector, are
    discussed. These assemblies could serve as a space for students to express their concerns and
    proposals directly. Furthermore, candidates for rector should be required to present their
    governance plans to students and address our concerns.**

    **Third Round: Final Conclusions**
    Michael Villalba:
    **In conclusion, the appointment of José Ismael Peña Reyes has highlighted the need to reform
    student participation mechanisms. We must work to ensure that students play a more prominent
    role in decisions that affect our university. Only then can we guarantee that the institution reflects
    our interests and aspirations.**

    Juan Camilo:
    **This process has shown that there is a significant gap between the authorities and the students.
    To bridge this gap, it is essential to promote a culture of inclusion and dialogue. The university

    should be a space where all voices are heard and respected, especially those of us who are its very
    reason for existing: the students.**

    **Moderator's Closing Remarks**
    Moderator:
    **I would like to thank Michael, Juan Camilo, and Juliana for their valuable contributions. This
    debate has made it clear that student participation is crucial for the future of the National
    University of Colombia. We hope these reflections will contribute to strengthening democratic
    processes and building a more inclusive and transparent institution. Thank you all for your
    attention.**`,
